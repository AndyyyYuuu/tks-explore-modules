Sounddraw.io was pretty cool to play with, since I have a soft spot for music. That orchestral music generated by AI does NOT sound orchestral. Some of it sounded like ads you'd see on TV. Others seemed to have south-east Asian elements mixed up with a whole bunch of other genres. I both love and hate those tracks.
