What do I think enables young people to build companies today that didnâ€™t exist 10+ years ago?
I'd attribute that to the phenomenal accessibility of information brought to us by the internet. You used to have to take a class or search a library to learn new things. Now you can just google tutorials, and there's one for anything. 
You could also attribute it to all the new technology popping up recently. With all these new things to learn, it levels the playing field; this knowledge is just as foreign to young people as it is to an older educated person. This gives young people a head start in learning new things and innovating quickly.
