How do I think schools should teach students about using LLMs like ChatGPT or BARD?
Imagine calculators on a math test. They're not banned but sometimes teachers don't let you use them for some questions. 
I think schools should encourage some use of LLMs for multiple purposes like enhancing vocabulary and asking questions. They should be treated like calculators, an effective tool that can aid learning but also hinder it if used incorrectly.
