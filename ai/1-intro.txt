Exploring AI with TKS's program here. I'm using text files instead of twitter (or "X") cause why not. 
I've already followed some PyTorch tutorials over the summer, but I'm looking for two things here: 
1) A better understanding of the concepts and math behind neural networks, which currently seem uncomprehensible to my tiny brain. 
2) An overview of the real-world applications of AI. 
Let's get started :)
