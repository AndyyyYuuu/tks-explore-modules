What's the difference between AI and machine learning? 
Machine learning is a technique that is used to create some but not all AI. A neural network is fed sets questions and expected responses. Over time, it modifies itself based on patterns recognize in these inputs and is able to better solve these problems. 
AI is a general term for any program used to mimic intellegence. It can include traditional algorithms like Minimax but also machine learning. 
Here's an analogy: AI is a class full of math students preparing for a test. Some prefer to memorize every formula in the textbook, but machine learning is this one kid who practices large amount of questions and checks the answers to get better.
